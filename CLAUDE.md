# English Trainer — Instructions

## Product Document
All design and development decisions MUST align with [PRODUCT.md](PRODUCT.md). Before implementing any feature, check the product document for:
- Core mechanics (Section 3)
- Current stage scope and what's in/out of scope (Section 4)
- User flow and state machine (Section 8)
- Tech stack (Section 6)
- Data model (Section 9)

## Tech Stack
- **Runtime:** Node.js + TypeScript
- **Bot framework:** grammY (TS-first Telegram bot framework)
- **Database:** SQLite + Prisma ORM
- **AI:** OpenAI API (GPT)
- **Dev mode:** long polling (no web server needed)

## Key Principles
- Keep it simple — MVP first, no over-engineering
- Telegram-native UX: reply keyboards for navigation, inline buttons for context actions
- State machine architecture for bot dialog flow
- All content generated by LLM, personalized per user
- Free text interpreted by current state context, not LLM-routing (for MVP)

## Language
- Code, comments, variable names — in English
- User-facing bot messages — in Russian (primary) and English (for exercises)
- Documentation — Russian or English depending on context
